# BudgetTracker
**Author: Petr Klátík**

The BudgetTracker App is a C# WPF application that allows users to manage their budgets, track income, expenses, and transactions. The app utilizes a client-server architecture, with a REST API serving as the backend and a WPF frontend for the user interface.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their profiles securely.
- Budget Data Management: Users can create, view, edit, and delete income, expenses, categories, and transactions.
- Local Storage and Synchronization: The app utilizes a local JSON file to store budget data offline and synchronizes it with the server-side database using a REST API.
- Reporting Functionality: Generate reports, graphs, and statistics based on the budget data, providing insights into spending patterns and financial health.

## Technologies Used

- C# .NET6 with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for the user interface.
- MSSQL database for storing budget data and user profiles.
- Entity Framework Core for data access and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- REST API built with ASP.NET Core for handling client-server communication.
- CommunityToolkit.Mvvm library for implementing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern.
- LiveCharts library for creating interactive charts and graphs in the reports.
